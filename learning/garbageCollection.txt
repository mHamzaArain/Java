Garbage collector
==================
1. In Java destruction of obj. from memory is done automatically 
    by the JVM.
2. "delte" keyword is only in C++.
3. Where there is no ref. to an obj, then that obj. is assumed 
    to be no longer needed & the memory occupied by the obj. 
    are realeased.
4. This technoque is called Garbage Collector. to
5. This is accomplished by JVM.

JVM Threads
------------ 
1. When you run a java program, JVM creates three threads.
    a. main thread -> The task of main thread is to execute the main() method.
    b. thread scheduler -> The task of thread scheduler is to schedule the threads.
    c. Garbage Collector Thread -> The task of garbage collector threads is to 
                        sweep out abondoned obj. from the heap memory.
2. In these threads, main thread is a user thread & remaining
    two are deamon threads which run in background.

finalize method
----------------
1. Garbage collector collector thread before sweeping out abondoned 
    obj, it calls finalize() method of the obj.
2. After finalize() method execute, obj. is destroyed from the consumed 
    memory.
3. We can call garbage collector explicitly using System.gc OR
    RunTime.getRunTime().gc().gc
    NOTE: It's just request to garbage collector not a command.
    It's upto garbage collector to honour this request.
4. Increase memory efficiency & decreases the chances of memory leak.
